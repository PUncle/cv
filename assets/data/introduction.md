# Hello!

I have worked in Engineering teams and independently on various Front End and Full Stack projects for over 20 years. I have expert experience with modern Javascript and Typescript as well as a passion for implementing thoughtful UI components leveraging modern CSS. I highly value UX, and will advocate for thoughtful and frictionless implementation of a UI and user story. I'm passionate about working on products that solve real world challenges and am happiest when working in a team of people who care.

I lead when required, but always seek opportunities to learn from my peers. What I crave most is a chance to write code with purpose, ownership and the opportunity to grow with that codebase.
