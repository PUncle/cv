# Hello

I have worked in teams and as a one man band on various front-end and full-stack projects on a freelance and contract basis. My staple over the past 10+ years has been CMS theme development, but over the years have found myself more interested in Javascript and Node development.

More generally, I highly value UX, and will advocate for thoughtful and frictionless implementation of a UI and user story. Iâ€™m happy to lead, but will take any opportunity to learn from others.

The majority of my code is kept privately at GitLab.com, as it is commissioned by clients; however I do have some recent code publicly available at [GitHub](https://github.com/PUncle/dontEat).
