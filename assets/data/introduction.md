# Hello!

I have worked both in teams and independently on various front-end and full-stack projects on a freelance and contract basis for 10+ years. I have plenty of experience with modern Javascript (Vue.js, Ember) as well as a passion for great UI components leveraging modern CSS. What I crave most is a chance to write code with purpose, ownership and the opportunity to grow with that codebase.

I highly value UX, and will advocate for thoughtful and frictionless implementation of a UI and user story. I'm passionate about working on products that solve real world challenges and am happiest when working in a team of people whom care. I will lead when required, but will always seek opportunities to learn from my peers.
