# Hello!

I have worked in teams and independently on various front end and full stack projects for over ten years. I have plenty of experience with modern Javascript (Vue.js, Ember) as well as a passion for great UI components leveraging modern CSS. I highly value UX, and will advocate for thoughtful and frictionless implementation of a UI and user story. I'm passionate about working on products that solve real world challenges and am happiest when working in a team of people who care.

I will lead when required, but always seek opportunities to learn from my peers. What I crave most is a chance to write code with purpose, ownership and the opportunity to grow with that codebase.
