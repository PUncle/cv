# Hello!

I have worked both in teams and independently on various front-end and full-stack projects on a freelance and contract basis for 10+ years. I have extensive experience with CMS theme development (Drupal, WordPress), but have immersed myself in ES6+ Javascript and Node development in recent years. I'm presently most interested in working with frameworks and libraries such as Vue, React and Ember; but what I crave most is a chance to write code with purpose, ownership and the opportunity to grow.

More generally, I highly value UX, and will advocate for thoughtful and frictionless implementation of a UI and user story. I'm passionate about working on products that solve real world challenges and thrive when working in a team. I'm happy to lead when required, but will always seek opportunities to learn from my peers.

The majority of my code is kept privately at GitLab.com, as it is commissioned by clients; however I do have some code publicly available at [GitHub.com/PUncle](https://github.com/PUncle).
