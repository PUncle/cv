# Hello!

I have worked in teams and independently on various front end and full stack projects for over fifteen years. I have plenty of experience with modern JS and Typescript, with Ember my framework of choice. I have a passion for doing things properly and not cutting corners. I highly value all forms of UX, and will advocate for thoughtful and frictionless implementation of everything I work on. I'm passionate about code that solves real world challenges and am happiest when working in a team of people who care.

I lead when required, but always seek opportunities to learn from my peers. What I crave most is a chance to write code with purpose, ownership and the opportunity to grow with that codebase.
